        <h3>Mari and I (마리와 나)</h3>
        <p>In JTBC ‘Mari and I’, Shim Hyung Tak and Seo In Guk work together to put six kittens up for adoption.

            On the upcoming episode of the program, Shim and Seo will be dispatched to the house of a client who brought a stray cat home which gave birth to six kittens in her house.
            
            The six siblings stole the hearts of Shim and Seo. However, they looked too similar to tell apart.
            
            The two guys brought the baby cats to a vet for a checkup before adoption. The kittens were shrewd enough to realize the situation and hid under the bed. After some struggles, they were presented before the vet. Shim and Seo, however, got teary eyes while watching the little ones crying in fear of the needles.
            
            Meanwhile, pet care variety show ‘Mari and I’ will air on January 27 at 10:50pm KST. (photo by JTBC)
