        <p>This was followed by B.I's release of a charity single album, Midnight Blue (Love Streaming), on March 19, 2021, through B.I's self-founded label, 131 Label, an affiliate of IOK Music. The label's name was inspired by the shape created when the letters "B" and "I" are combined. The debut single album contained three self-written songs, and an animated music video for lead single "Midnight Blue" was released on the same day. All tracks had been previously released, partially, as demos via B.I's SoundCloud between 2020 and 2021.</p>
        <p>On May 7, 2021, 131 Label announced the release schedule for B.I as a solo artist. This included a global single "Got It Like That" featuring American artists Destiny Rogers and Tyla Yaweh, released on May 14, 2021, and his first full-length studio album, Waterfall, released on June 1, 2021. Waterfall featured former label-mates Lee Hi and Tablo of Epik High. A cinematic music video for the title track "Illa Illa" was also released alongside the album. The music video surpassed 12.7 million views on YouTube within the first 24 hours of its release, breaking the record for the most viewed K-pop male solo artist debut music video within the first 24 hours.</p>
