The song, a trap-dance track driven by wailing synths and a riotous beat, describes feelings after a "painful breakup"; its title was inspired by the common phrase "this is killing me". The music video conveyed the emotional devastation described in the lyrics through the use of flames, darkness, brightly hued sets, and expressive dance movements. "Freedom" was released as the second single (referred to as "sub title") of the album on August 2. It is described as a rock-infused song.</p></th>
